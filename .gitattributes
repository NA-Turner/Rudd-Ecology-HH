## .gitattributes for Git LFS (Large File Storage)
##
## This file tells Git which files should be tracked via LFS instead
## of the standard Git storage method.
##
## LFS is designed for large files (datasets, images, binaries) that
## would otherwise bloat the repository size and slow down cloning.
##
## How it works:
##   - Files matching these patterns are tracked in version control
##   - But their contents are stored on a separate LFS server
##   - Git stores only a small pointer file in the repository
##   - When you clone/pull, Git automatically downloads the actual files
##
## IMPORTANT:
##   - You must have Git LFS installed (see GIT_LFS_SETUP.md)
##   - Do NOT add these files to .gitignore
##   - LFS tracking is set up once; afterwards it works automatically

# Track ALL files in the "01 - Large Files" subdirectory via LFS
# This is intended for large datasets that need version control
