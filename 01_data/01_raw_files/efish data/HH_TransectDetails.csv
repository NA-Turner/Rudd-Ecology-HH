HH10A,HH10A,,,1,Boulder,7,4,No,East,,"10A-12A occurred during times when water levels were too low to sample behind the islands so we sampled in front of the islands instead which is very different habitat and quite deep with hazardous, random boulders.  I can't remember why we did that- probably because Bob said so"
